TO DO:

 - Shuffle decks in place and draw from the top of the deck
 - Break up deck analysis into different files based of functions
 - Create a file system that relates files to functionality aka base functionality like drawing in one folder set and higher level functionality in other folders
 - Create Card Class
 - Create Field Class
 - Create Card database that is expandable!!
 - Create analysis system that plays decks based off of options available and not based off of known combos
   - Unless the analysis figures out combos?


TO DO (ALTON/ANALYSIS):

 - Come up with useful metrics
 - Save, Visualize, and Analyize decision trees?
 - Measure consistency-power payoff (Consistent but weak? Inconsistent but strong when it works? Neither? Both?)
 - Be able to compare different decks





TODO:
 - Adjust anycard combo checking to be smarter on what cards to discard
 - Make actions smarter so you dont need to add -1s everywhere
 - optional combos
 - super combos (analytics)
 - too many strings in combo movements
 - DISCARDING SUCKS
