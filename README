TO DO:

 - Shuffle decks in place and draw from the top of the deck
 - Break up deck analysis into different files based of functions
 - Create a file system that relates files to functionality aka base functionality like drawing in one folder set and higher level functionality in other folders
 - Create Card Class
 - Create Field Class
 - Create Card database that is expandable!!

   - Unless the analysis figures out combos?


TO DO (ALTON/ANALYSIS):

 - Come up with useful metrics
 - Save, Visualize, and Analyize decision trees?
